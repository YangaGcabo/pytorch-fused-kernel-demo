# PyTorch Fused Kernel Demo

This project demonstrates the idea of operator fusion in PyTorch.
It focuses on combining multiple operations into a single efficient step.

## What is implemented
- Simple fused add + ReLU operation
- Clean PyTorch implementation

## Why this matters
Operator fusion is important for performance in deep learning systems.
This project shows conceptual understanding of low-level ML optimisation.

## Tools used
- PyTorch
